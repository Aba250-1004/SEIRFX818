# Functions with Python

## Objectives

After this lesson students will be able to

* Write a Python function using the `def` keyword
* Include parameters and return statements in a Python function
* Describe the use of the `global` keyword
* Use named parameters and default values for arguments to a function

## The Basics

A function in Python has the same purpose as a function in other languages: To write reusable code that can be run at any time after the function as been written. If you're hopping over to Python after using JavaScript, you'll be relieved to hear that there is only really one way in Python to write functions!
