### What is the Raspberry Pi

From [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#introduction):

```
"Raspberry Pi is the third best-selling computer brand in the world. The Raspberry Pi is a credit cardâ€“sized computer that plugs into your TV or display, and a keyboard and mouse. You can use it to learn coding and to build electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games. It also plays high-definition video. The Raspberry Pi is being used by adults and children all over the world to learn programming and digital making."
```

### What are all these options? What do I buy?

For your first project, it can be nice to buy a kit that includes all the things you need. This pretty much ensures everything is plug-and-play or ready to go. That said, if you want to save a little on cost, buying the constituent pieces and setting them up is still pretty straight-forward!

### How do I set it up?

### Where is the on/off switch

There isn't one! You just plug it in! ðŸ˜„

That said, if you have purchased a battery pack for making your Raspberry Pi mobile (for example, for making a robot car), then that will likely have an on/off switch.
